// Notice the private inner static class that contains the instance of the
// singleton class. When the singleton class is loaded, SingletonHelper class is
// not loaded into memory and only when someone calls the getInstance method,
// this class gets loaded and creates the Singleton class instance.
// This is the most widely used approach for Singleton class as it doesnâ€™t
// require synchronization

// reflection can break this singleton pattern and double checking and almost
// all other except enum

// use cases of singleton are in logging, driver connection and cache and other
// cross-cutting concern etc
